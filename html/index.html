                This is the default welcome page used to test the correct 
                operation of the Apache2 server after installation on Ubuntu systems.
                It is based on the equivalent page on Debian, from which the Ubuntu Apache
                packaging is derived.
                If you can read this page, it means that the Apache HTTP server installed at
                this site is working properly. You should <b>replace this file</b> (located at
                <tt>/var/www/html/index.html</tt>) before continuing to operate your HTTP server.
          </p>

                If you are a normal user of this web site and don't know what this page is
                about, this probably means that the site is currently unavailable due to
                maintenance.
                If the problem persists, please contact the site's administrator.

                Configuration Overview
        </div>
        <div class="content_section_text">
          <p>
                Ubuntu's Apache2 default configuration is different from the
                upstream default configuration, and split into several files optimized for
                interaction with Ubuntu tools. The configuration system is
                <b>fully documented in
                /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz</b>. Refer to this for the full
                documentation. Documentation for the web server itself can be
                found by accessing the <a href="/manual">manual</a> if the <tt>apache2-doc</tt>
                package was installed on this server.
          </p>
          <p>
                The configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on Ubuntu systems is as follows:
          </p>
          <pre>
/etc/apache2/
|-- apache2.conf
|       `--  ports.conf
|-- mods-enabled
|       |-- *.load
|       `-- *.conf
|-- conf-enabled
|       `-- *.conf
|-- sites-enabled
|       `-- *.conf
          </pre>
          <ul>
                        <li>
                           <tt>apache2.conf</tt> is the main configuration
                           file. It puts the pieces together by including all remaining configuration
                           files when starting up the web server.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                           <tt>ports.conf</tt> is always included from the
                           main configuration file. It is used to determine the listening ports for
                           incoming connections, and this file can be customized anytime.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                           Configuration files in the <tt>mods-enabled/</tt>,
                           <tt>conf-enabled/</tt> and <tt>sites-enabled/</tt> directories contain
                           particular configuration snippets which manage modules, global configuration
                           fragments, or virtual host configurations, respectively.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                           They are activated by symlinking available
                           configuration files from their respective
                           *-available/ counterparts. These should be managed
                           by using our helpers
                           <tt>
                                a2enmod,
                                a2dismod,
                           </tt>
                           <tt>

                                and

                        <li>
                           The binary is called apache2 and is managed using systemd, so to
                           start/stop the service use <tt>systemctl start apache2</tt> and
                           <tt>systemctl stop apache2</tt>, and use <tt>systemctl status apache2</tt>
                           and <tt>journalctl -u apache2</tt> to check status.  <tt>system</tt>
                           and <tt>apache2ctl</tt> can also be used for service management if
                           desired.
                           <b>Calling <tt>/usr/bin/apache2</tt> directly will not work</b> with the
                           default configuration.

                By default, Ubuntu does not allow access through the web browser to

                applications). If your site is using a web document root
                located elsewhere (such as in <tt>/srv</tt>) you may need to whitelist your
